Simple app for validating and fixing documentation.


The Role of AI in Developing this Project:

The purpose of this package was 1) to develop a useful tool for validating
docstrings, 2) to learn about prompting large language models, and 3) most importantly
to improve my software engineering skills. 

There are three areas that AI contributed to:

- Writing unit tests (I find this boring)
- Writing documentation and docstrings (I also find this boring)
- Automating the repetititive parts of prompt building (e.g., adding examples, inserting the pydantic json schema into the prompt, etc.)

In all cases, any AI generated outputs underwent human review for accuracy.

Otherwise, all python scripts and the python source code were written manually. 
Using AI to automatically generate the actual functionality of the application
would defeat the purpose of this project as a learning opportunity, and I
would like to keep it that way.

I welcome contributions from the community, but please do not submit pull
requests built with "vibe coding" and only leverage AI generated code
 for the areas referenced above. For this project, I value the learning 
component more than quick iteration and development of features. 
If you feel strongly about this, then you are welcome to develop 
your own fork of the repo.
